# Sparta_Global_Cucumber_Features_Lab
## The task
This project involved testing the login feature of the bbc website, testing that errors given for a variety of valid/invalid scenarios allow the user to log in or show the correct error messages. The tests were written in Gherkin and run using cucumber.
